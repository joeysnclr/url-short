![](https://josephsinclair.me/static/images/URLShort.png)

URL Short is exactly what it sounds like. A URL Shortener! My goal with this project was to establish my skills using React and creating an API, while creating something that could be useful in my day to day life.

## What I Learned
From this project I learned how to develop a full stack application using NodeJS, Express, React, and MongoDB.

## Features
This web application features a user interface for shortening URLs, a URL shortener API, as well as an analytics page to view the activity of your shortened link.
